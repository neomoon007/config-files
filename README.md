# Config Files
These are my config files.

## Install
To install my config files copy them to they're proper location. For example, to use my zsh config, do the following:
1. Copy .zshrc to the home directory
2. Copy the zsh/ directory to .config/zsh

The same to my nvim config:
1. Copy the nvim/ directory to .config/nvim/

## Dependencies and preferences
- Starship.rs (for my zsh config)
- Neovim 0.9 or above (prefer to build from source)
- Catpputtin theme (for the terminal)
- Mononoki Nerd Font (for the terminal)
